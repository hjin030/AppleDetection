# AppleDetection

This apple detection method was built based on the yolo algorithm with opencv in python.

The det1 python file uses pre-defined model called coco.name and the yolo-obejct-dect python file uses machine learning method such as yolo-train model with darknet.

The code is built from opensources and libararies which can be found in below links.
